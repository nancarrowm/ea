Small repository to share specific, as-needed scripts. Nothing more, maybe less. 

Each folder is just a set of scripts to perform a function. I've used AI to summarise the script and create a readme file for it. Hopefully accurate. 

Scripts are built for their environment. Won't necessarily work elsewhere. 

Scripts are built for devices fitting 'compliant' states. If your devices aren't following compliance, don't expect it to work.
